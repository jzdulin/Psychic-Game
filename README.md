# Psychic-Game

Made a game where the computer chooses a random letter and then the user gets to try and guess which letter that was.
They have 9 attempts to guess the correct letter.
It lists the previously guessed letters.
It tracks wins and loses. 

To start playing guess a random letter on your keyboard by pushing it.

To improve the game it could be modified so that it doesn't let you guess the same letter twice, 
it already tells you you already guessed it but it doesn't actually stop you from clicking it.
